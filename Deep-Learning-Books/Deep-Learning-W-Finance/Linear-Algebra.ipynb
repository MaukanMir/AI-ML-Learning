    "- A linear equation is a representation in which the highest exponent on any variable is one. This means that there are no variables that are raised to the power of two and above. \n",

    "#### Trigonometric functions are mathematical functions used to relate the angles of a right triangle to the ratios of its sides. They have various applications in fields like geometry, physics, engineering, and more. They help analyze and solve problems related to angles, distances, oscillations, and waveforms, among other things.\n",

    "## Optimization\n",
    "- In optimization methods like gradient descent, limits can be used to regulate the step size and guarantee convergence to a local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature selection\n",
    "- Limits can be used to rank the significance of various model features and perform feature selection, which can make the model simpler and perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sensitivity analysis\n",
    "- A machine learning model’s sensitivity to changes in input data and its capacity to generalize to new data can be used to examine a model’s behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limits\n",
    "- The main aim of limits is to know the value of a function when it’s undefined. But what is an undefined function? When you have a function that gives a solution that is not possible (such as dividing by zero), limits help you bypass this issue in order to know the value of the function at that point. So the aim of limits is to solve functions even when they are undefined."
