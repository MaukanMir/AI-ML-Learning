    "## Fractional differentiation \n",
    "\n",
    "#### is a mathematical technique used to transform a time series into a stationary series while preserving some of its memory. It extends the concept of differencing (or taking the returns), which is commonly used to remove trends and make time series stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In traditional differencing, the data sequence is differenced by a whole number, typically 1, which involves subtracting the previous value from the current value. This helps eliminate trends and makes the series stationary. However, in some cases, the series may exhibit long-term dependencies or memory effects that are not effectively captured by traditional differencing. These dependencies may help in forecasting the time series, and if they are completely eliminated, that may hinder the ability of the algorithm to perform well. These dependencies are referred to as memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fractional differentiation addresses this limitation by allowing the differencing parameter to be a fractional value. The fractional differencing operator effectively applies a weighted sum of lagged values to each observation in the series, with the weights determined by the fractional differencing parameter. This allows for capturing long-term dependencies or memory effects in the series. Fractional differentiation is particularly useful in financial time series analysis, where data often exhibits long memory or persistent behavior. \n",

    "#### The forecasting threshold is the minimum required percentage prediction to validate a signal. This means that the forecasting threshold technique is a filter that removes low conviction predictions."
