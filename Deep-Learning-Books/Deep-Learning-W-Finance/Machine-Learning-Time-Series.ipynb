    "#### The risk-free rate refers to the theoretical rate of return on an investment that carries no risk. It serves as a benchmark for evaluating the potential returns of other investments that do involve risk. In practice, the risk-free rate is typically based on the yield of a government-issued bond, usually one with a short-term maturity."
