    "#### The risk-free rate refers to the theoretical rate of return on an investment that carries no risk. It serves as a benchmark for evaluating the potential returns of other investments that do involve risk. In practice, the risk-free rate is typically based on the yield of a government-issued bond, usually one with a short-term maturity."

    "#### In simple terms, R² represents the proportion of the dependent variable’s variability that can be attributed to the independent variable(s) included in the model. It provides a measure of how well the regression model fits the observed data. However, it does not indicate the causal relationship between variables or the overall quality of the model. It is also worth noting that R² is the squared correlation between the two variables. "
