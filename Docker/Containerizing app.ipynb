This pulls an image that will be used as the base layer for the image the Dockerfile will build – everything else will be added as new layers above this base layer. The app being defined in this Dockerfile is a Linux app, so it’s important that the FROM instruction refers to a Linux-based image. If you’re containerizing a Windows application, you’ll need to specify an appropriate Windows base image.\n",
