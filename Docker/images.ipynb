    "#### Image, Docker image, container image, and OCI image all mean the same thing. We’ll use the terms interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A container image is read-only package that contains everything you need to run an application. It includes application code, application dependencies, a minimal set of OS constructs, and metadata. A single image can be used to start one or more containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If you’re familiar with VMware, you can think of images as similar to VM templates. A VM template is like a stopped VM — a container image is like a stopped container. If you’re a developer you can think of them as similar to classes. You can create one or more objects from a class — you can create one or more containers from an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Images are made up of multiple layers that are stacked on top of each other and represented as a single object. Inside of the image is a cut-down operating system (OS) and all of the files and dependencies required to run an application. Because containers are intended to be fast and lightweight, images tend to be small (Windows images tend to be huge).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We’ve mentioned a couple of times already that images are like stopped containers. In fact, you can stop a container and create a new image from it. With this in mind, images are considered build-time constructs, whereas containers are run-time constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Figure 6.1 shows high-level view of the relationship between images and containers. We use the docker run and docker service create commands to start one or more containers from a single image. Once you’ve started a container from an image, the two constructs become dependent on each other, and you cannot delete the image until the last container using it has been stopped and destroyed."
