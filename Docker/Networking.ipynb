    "#### The atomic unit of scheduling on Docker is the container, and as the name suggests, the Container Network Model is all about providing networking for containers. Figure 11.3 shows how CNM components relate to containers — sandboxes are placed inside of containers to provide network connectivity.\n",

The two containers can communicate because they are both connected to Network A. However, the two endpoints in Container B cannot communicate with each other without the assistance of a layer 3 router.\n",

    "#### It’s also important to understand that endpoints behave like regular network adapters, meaning they can only be connected to a single network. Therefore, a container needing to connect to multiple networks will need multiple endpoints."
