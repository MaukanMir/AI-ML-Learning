    "\n",
    "### As opposed to the Lambda architecture, which is designed to handle both real-time and batch data, Kappa is designed to handle just real-time data. And like the Lambda architecture, Kappa architecture is also designed to handle high levels of concurrency and high volumes of data. FigureÂ 7-4 provides a high-level overview of the Kappa architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The three key principles of the Kappa architecture are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-time processing\n",
    "- The Kappa architecture is designed for real-time processing, which means that events are processed as soon as they are received rather than being batch processed later. This decreases latency and enables the system to respond quickly to changing conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single event stream\n",
    "- The Kappa architecture uses a single event stream to store all data that flows through the system. This allows for easy scalability and fault tolerance, since the data can be distributed easily across multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stateless processing\n",
    "- In the Kappa architecture, all processing is stateless. This means that each event is processed independently, without relying on the state of previous events. This makes it easier to scale the system, because there is no need to maintain state across multiple node"
