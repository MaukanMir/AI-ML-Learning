    "#### With Kubernetes, everything is represented declaratively. This means that you write down the desired state of the application in the cluster (generally in YAML or JSON files), and these declared desired states define all the pieces of your application. This declarative approach is far preferable to an imperative approach in which the state of your cluster is the sum of a series of changes to the cluster. If a cluster is configured imperatively, it is difficult to understand and replicate how the cluster came to be in that state, making it challenging to understand or recover from problems with your application."
