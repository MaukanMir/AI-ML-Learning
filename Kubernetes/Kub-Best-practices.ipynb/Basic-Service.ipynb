    "#### With Kubernetes, everything is represented declaratively. This means that you write down the desired state of the application in the cluster (generally in YAML or JSON files), and these declared desired states define all the pieces of your application. This declarative approach is far preferable to an imperative approach in which the state of your cluster is the sum of a series of changes to the cluster. If a cluster is configured imperatively, it is difficult to understand and replicate how the cluster came to be in that state, making it challenging to understand or recover from problems with your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When declaring the state of your application, people typically prefer YAML to JSON, though Kubernetes supports them both. This is because YAML is somewhat less verbose and more human editable than JSON. However, it’s worth noting that YAML is indentation sensitive; often errors in Kubernetes configurations can be traced to incorrect indentation in YAML. If things aren’t behaving as expected, checking your indentation is a good place to start troubleshooting. Most editors have syntax highlighting support for both JSON and YAML. When working with these files it is a good idea to install such tools to make it easier to find both author and file errors in your configurations. There is also an excellent extension for Visual Studio Code that supports richer error checking for Kubernetes files."

    "## Best Practices for Image Management\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Though in general, building and maintaining container images is beyond the scope of this book, it’s worthwhile to identify some general best practices for building and naming images. In general, the image build process can be vulnerable to “supply-chain attacks.” In such attacks, a malicious user injects code or binaries into some dependency from a trusted source that is then built into your application. Because of the risk of such attacks, it is critical that when you build your images you base them on only well-known and trusted image providers. Alternatively, you can build all your images from scratch. Building from scratch is easy for some languages (e.g., Go) that can build static binaries, but it is significantly more complicated for interpreted languages like Python, JavaScript, or Ruby.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The other best practices for images relate to naming. Though the version of a container image in an image registry is theoretically mutable, you should treat the version tag as immutable. In particular, some combination of the semantic version and the SHA hash of the commit where the image was built is a good practice for naming images (e.g., v1.0.1-bfeda01f). If you don’t specify an image version, latest is used by default. Although this can be convenient in development, it is a bad idea for production usage because latest is clearly being mutated every time a new image is built."

    "## Creating a Replicated Application\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our frontend application is stateless; it relies entirely on the Redis backend for its state. As a result, we can replicate it arbitrarily without affecting traffic. Though our application is unlikely to sustain large-scale usage, it’s still a good idea to run with at least two replicas so that you can handle an unexpected crash or roll out a new version of the application without downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Kubernetes, the ReplicaSet resource is the one that directly manages replicating a specific version of your containerized application. Since the version of all applications changes over time as you modify the code, it is not a best practice to use a ReplicaSet directly. Instead, you use the Deployment resource. A Deployment combines the replication capabilities of ReplicaSet with versioning and the ability to perform a staged rollout. By using a Deployment you can use Kubernetes’ built-in tooling to move from one version of the application to the next."

    "#### There are several things to note in this Deployment. First is that we are using Labels to identify the Deployment as well as the ReplicaSets and the pods that the Deployment creates. We’ve added the app: frontend label to all these resources so that we can examine all resources for a particular layer in a single request. You’ll see that as we add other resources, we’ll follow the same practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You should also note that for the containers in the Deployment we have specified both Request and Limit resource requests, and we’ve set Request equal to Limit. When running an application, the Request is the reservation that is guaranteed on the host machine where it runs. The Limit is the maximum resource usage that the container will be allowed. When you are starting out, setting Request equal to Limit will lead to the most predictable behavior of your application. This predictability comes at the expense of resource utilization. Because setting Request equal to Limit prevents your applications from overscheduling or consuming excess idle resources, you will not be able to drive maximal utilization unless you tune Request and Limit very, very carefully. As you become more advanced in your understanding of the Kubernetes resource model, you might consider modifying Request and Limit for your application independently, but in general most users find that the stability from predictability is worth the reduced utilization."
