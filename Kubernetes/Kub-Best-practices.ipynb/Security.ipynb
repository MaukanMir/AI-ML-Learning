    "#### OpenSSF Scorecard gives an automated set of tools that provide a 0â€“10 score on the security posture of an open source repository that you might be using or considering to use as a dependency. The aggregate score provides an at-a-glance view that can be used to evaluate how trustworthy an open source project is. Many prominent open source projects are adopting this scorecard."
