    "#### CD is the process by which changes that have passed successfully through the CI pipeline are deployed to production without human intervention. Containers provide a great advantage for deploying changes into production. Container images become an immutable object that can be promoted through dev and staging and into production. For example, a major issue we’ve always had has been maintaining consistent environments. Almost everyone has experienced a Deployment that works fine in staging, but when it gets promoted to production, it breaks. This is due to having configuration drift, with libraries and versioning of components differing in each environment. Kubernetes gives us a declarative way to describe our Deployment objects that can be versioned and deployed consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One thing to keep in mind is that you need a solid CI pipeline set up before focusing on CD. If you don’t have a robust set of tests to catch issues early in the pipeline, you’ll end up rolling bad code to all your environments.\n"

And even though it has a built-in mechanism to provide rolling updates, you can also utilize more advanced strategies. Here, we examine the following strategies to deliver updates to your application:\n",

For example, if you took your frontend app that is currently running frontend:v1 and updated the Deployment to frontend:v2, Kubernetes would update the replicas in a rolling fashion to frontend:v2"

    "#### Blue/green deployments allow you to release your application predictably. With blue/green deployments, you control when the traffic is shifted over to the new environment, so it gives you a lot of control over the rollout of a new version of your application. With blue/green deployments, you are required to have the capacity to deploy both the existing and new environment at the same time. These types of deployments have a lot of advantages, such as easily switching back to your previous version of the application. There are some things that you need to consider with this deployment strategy, however:\n",

For example, you might roll out a new version of an application and want to test the deployment for only 10% of your user base. This allows you to reduce the risk of a bad deployment or broken features to a much smaller subset of users. If there are no errors with the deployment or new features, you can begin shifting a greater percentage of traffic to the new version of the application. There are also more advanced techniques that you can use with canary deployments in which you release to only a specific region of users or only target users with a specific profile. These types of releases are often referred to as A/B or dark releases because users are unaware they are testing new feature deployments.\n",

    "#### Your CI/CD pipeline won’t be perfect on day one, but consider some of the following best practices to iteratively improve on the pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With CI, focus on automation and providing quick builds. Optimizing the build speed will provide developers quick feedback if their changes have broken the build.\n",
    "- Focus on providing reliable tests in your pipeline. This will give developers rapid feedback on issues with their code. The faster the feedback loop to developers, the more productive they’ll become in their workflow.\n",
    "- When deciding on CI/CD tools, ensure that the tools allow you to define the pipeline as code. This will allow you to version-control the pipeline with your application code.\n",
    "- Ensure that you optimize your images so that you can reduce the size of the image and also reduce the attack surface when running the image in production. Multistage Docker builds allow you to remove packages not needed for the application to run. For example, you might need Maven to build the application, but you don’t need it for the actual running image.\n",
    "- Avoid using “latest” as an image tag, and utilize a tag that can be referenced back to the buildID or Git commit.\n",
    "- If you are new to CD, utilize Kubernetes rolling updates to start. They are easy to use and will get you comfortable with deployment. As you become more comfortable and confident with CD, look at utilizing blue/green and canary deployment strategies.\n",
    "- With CD, ensure that you test how client connections and database schema upgrades are handled in your application.\n",
    "- Testing in production will help you build reliability into your application and ensure that you have good monitoring in place. With testing in production, also start at a small scale and limit the blast radius of the experiment."
