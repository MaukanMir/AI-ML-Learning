    "## Kubernetes Scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Kubernetes scheduler is one of the main components that is hosted in the control plane. The scheduler allows Kubernetes to make placement decisions for pods deployed to the cluster. It deals with optimization of resources based on constraints of the cluster as well as user-specified constraints. It uses a scoring algorithm that is based on predicates and priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predicates\n",
    "#### The first function Kubernetes uses to make a scheduling decision is the predicate function, which determines what nodes the pods can be scheduled on. It implies a hard constraint, so it returns a value of true or false. An example would be when a pod requests 4 GB of memory and a node cannot satisfy this requirement. The node would return a false value and would be removed from viable nodes for the pod to be scheduled to. Another example would be if the node is set to unschedulable; it would then be removed from the scheduling decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Priorities\n",
    "#### Whereas predicates indicate a true or false value and dismiss a node for scheduling, the priority value ranks all the valid nodes based on a relative value.\n",
    "#### The scores will be added, and then a node is given its final score to indicate its priority. For example, if a pod requires 600 millicores and there are two nodes, one with 900 millicores available and one with 1,800 millicores, the node with 1,800 millicores available will have a higher priority."

    "- Best effort\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The pod is assigned a QoS of guaranteed when CPU and memory both have request and limits that match. A burstable QoS is when the limits are set higher than the request, meaning that the container is guaranteed its request, but it can also burst to the limit set for the container. A pod is assigned best effort when no request or limits are set for the containers in the pod."

    "## PodDisruptionBudgets\n",
    "\n",
    "#### At some point in time, Kubernetes might need to evict pods from a host. There are two types of evictions: voluntary and involuntary disruptions. Involuntary disruptions can be caused by hardware failure, network partitions, kernel panics, or a node being out of resources. Voluntary evictions can be caused by performing maintenance on the cluster, the Cluster Autoscaler deallocating nodes, or updating pod templates. To minimize the impact to your application, you can set a PodDisruptionBudget to ensure uptime of the application when pods need to be evicted. A PodDisruptionBudget allows you to set a policy on the minimum available and maximum unavailable pods during voluntary eviction events. An example of a voluntary eviction would be when draining a node to perform maintenance on the node.\n",
