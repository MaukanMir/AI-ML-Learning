    "### Step 1: Project scoping\n",
    "- A project starts with scoping the project, laying out goals, objectives, and constraints. Stakeholders should be identified and involved. Resources should be estimated and allocated. We already discussed different stakeholders and some of the foci for ML projects in production in Chapter 1. We also already discussed how to scope an ML project in the context of a business earlier in this chapter. We’ll discuss how to organize teams to ensure the success of an ML project in Chapter 11.\n",

    "### Step 2. Data engineering\n",
    "- A vast majority of ML models today learn from data, so developing ML models starts with engineering data. In Chapter 3, we’ll discuss the fundamentals of data engineering, which covers handling data from different sources and formats. With access to raw data, we’ll want to curate training data out of it by sampling and generating labels, which is discussed in Chapter 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3. ML model development\n",
    "- With the initial set of training data, we’ll need to extract features and develop initial models leveraging these features. This is the stage that requires the most ML knowledge and is most often covered in ML courses. In Chapter 5, we’ll discuss feature engineering. In Chapter 6, we’ll discuss model selection, training, and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4. Deployment\n",
    "- After a model is developed, it needs to be made accessible to users. Developing an ML system is like writing—you will never reach the point when your system is done. But you do reach the point when you have to put your system out there. We’ll discuss different ways to deploy an ML model in Chapter 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5. Monitoring and continual learning\n",
    "- Once in production, models need to be monitored for performance decay and maintained to be adaptive to changing environments and changing requirements. This step will be discussed in Chapters 8 and 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6. Business analysis\n",
    "- Model performance needs to be evaluated against business goals and analyzed to generate business insights. These insights can then be used to eliminate unproductive projects or scope out new projects. This step is closely related to the first step."
