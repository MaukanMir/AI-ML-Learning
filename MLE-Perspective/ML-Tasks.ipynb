    "### When the number of classes is high, such as disease diagnosis where the number of diseases can go up to thousands or product classifications where the number of products can go up to tens of thousands, we say the classification task has high cardinality. High cardinality problems can be very challenging. The first challenge is in data collection. In my experience, ML models typically need at least 100 examples for each class to learn to classify that class. So if you have 1,000 classes, you already need at least 100,000 examples. The data collection can be especially difficult for rare classes. When you have thousands of classes, it’s likely that some of them are rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When the number of classes is large, hierarchical classification might be useful. In hierarchical classification, you have a classifier to first classify each example into one of the large groups. Then you have another classifier to classify this example into one of the subgroups. For example, for product classification, you can first classify each product into one of the four main categories: electronics, home and kitchen, fashion, or pet supplies. After a product has been classified into a category, say fashion, you can use another classifier to put this product into one of the subgroups: shoes, shirts, jeans, or accessories."

    "### In both binary and multiclass classification, each example belongs to exactly one class. When an example can belong to multiple classes, we have a multilabel classification problem. For example, when building a model to classify articles into four topics—tech, entertainment, finance, and politics—an article can be in both tech and finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are two major approaches to multilabel classification problems. The first is to treat it as you would a multiclass classification. In multiclass classification, if there are four possible classes [tech, entertainment, finance, politics] and the label for an example is entertainment, you represent this label with the vector [0, 1, 0, 0]. In multilabel classification, if an example has both labels entertainment and finance, its label will be represented as [0, 1, 1, 0]."
