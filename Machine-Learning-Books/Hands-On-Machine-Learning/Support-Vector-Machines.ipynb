    "#### A support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful and versatile machine learning model, capable of performing linear or nonlinear classification, regression, and even novelty detection. SVMs shine with small to medium-sized nonlinear datasets (i.e., hundreds to thousands of instances), especially for classification tasks. However, they don’t scale very well to very large datasets, as you will see.\n",

    "#### If we strictly impose that all instances must be off the street and on the correct side, this is called hard margin classification. There are two main issues with hard margin classification. First, it only works if the data is linearly separable. Second, it is sensitive to outliers. Figure 5-3 shows the iris dataset with just one additional outlier: on the left, it is impossible to find a hard margin; on the right, the decision boundary ends up very different from the one we saw in Figure 5-1 without the outlier, and the model will probably not generalize as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To avoid these issues, we need to use a more flexible model. The objective is to find a good balance between keeping the street as large as possible and limiting the margin violations (i.e., instances that end up in the middle of the street or even on the wrong side). This is called soft margin classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When creating an SVM model using Scikit-Learn, you can specify several hyperparameters, including the regularization hyperparameter C. If you set it to a low value, then you end up with the model on the left of Figure 5-4. With a high value, you get the model on the right. As you can see, reducing C makes the street larger, but it also leads to more margin violations. In other words, reducing C results in more instances supporting the street, so there’s less risk of overfitting. But if you reduce it too much, then the model ends up underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your SVM model is overfitting, you can try regularizing it by reducing C.\n"
