    "## The Vanishing/Exploding Gradients Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unfortunately, gradients often get smaller and smaller as the algorithm progresses down to the lower layers. As a result, the gradient descent update leaves the lower layers’ connection weights virtually unchanged, and training never converges to a good solution. This is called the vanishing gradients problem. In some cases, the opposite can happen: the gradients can grow bigger and bigger until layers get insanely large weight updates and the algorithm diverges. This is the exploding gradients problem, which surfaces most often in recurrent neural networks (see Chapter 15). More generally, deep neural networks suffer from unstable gradients; different layers may learn at widely different speeds."

    "#### Although using He initialization along with ReLU (or any of its variants) can significantly reduce the danger of the vanishing/exploding gradients problems at the beginning of training, it doesn’t guarantee that they won’t come back during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In a 2015 paper,⁠12 Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy proposed a technique called batch normalization (BN) that addresses these problems. The technique consists of adding an operation in the model just before or after the activation function of each hidden layer. This operation simply zero-centers and normalizes each input, then scales and shifts the result using two new parameter vectors per layer: one for scaling, the other for shifting. In other words, the operation lets the model learn the optimal scale and mean of each of the layer’s inputs. In many cases, if you add a BN layer as the very first layer of your neural network, you do not need to standardize your training set. That is, there’s no need for StandardScaler or Normalization; the BN layer will do it for you (well, approximately, since it only looks at one batch at a time, and it can also rescale and shift each input feature)."

    "## Gradient Clipping\n",

    "#### Another technique to mitigate the exploding gradients problem is to clip the gradients during backpropagation so that they never exceed some threshold. This is called gradient clipping.⁠14 This technique is generally used in recurrent neural networks, where using batch normalization is tricky (as you will see in Chapter 15).\n",
    "\n",

    "#### It is generally not a good idea to train a very large DNN from scratch without first trying to find an existing neural network that accomplishes a similar task to the one you are trying to tackle (I will discuss how to find them in Chapter 14). If you find such as neural network, then you can generally reuse most of its layers, except for the top ones. This technique is called transfer learning. It will not only speed up training considerably, but also requires significantly less training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Try freezing all the reused layers first (i.e., make their weights non-trainable so that gradient descent won’t modify them and they will remain fixed), then train your model and see how it performs. Then try unfreezing one or two of the top hidden layers to let backpropagation tweak them and see if performance improves. The more training data you have, the more layers you can unfreeze. It is also useful to reduce the learning rate when you unfreeze reused layers: this will avoid wrecking their fine-tuned weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If you still cannot get good performance, and you have little training data, try dropping the top hidden layer(s) and freezing all the remaining hidden layers again. You can iterate until you find the right number of layers to reuse. If you have plenty of training data, you may try replacing the top hidden layers instead of dropping them, and even adding more hidden layers.\n",

    "## Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Imagine a bowling ball rolling down a gentle slope on a smooth surface: it will start out slowly, but it will quickly pick up momentum until it eventually reaches terminal velocity (if there is some friction or air resistance). This is the core idea behind momentum optimization, proposed by Boris Polyak in 1964.⁠15 In contrast, regular gradient descent will take small steps when the slope is gentle and big steps when the slope is steep, but it will never pick up speed. As a result, regular gradient descent is generally much slower to reach the minimum than momentum optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The one drawback of momentum optimization is that it adds yet another hyperparameter to tune. However, the momentum value of 0.9 usually works well in practice and almost always goes faster than regular gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Rate Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding a good learning rate is very important. If you set it much too high, training may diverge (as discussed in “Gradient Descent”). If you set it too low, training will eventually converge to the optimum, but it will take a very long time. If you set it slightly too high, it will make progress very quickly at first, but it will end up dancing around the optimum and never really settling down. If you have a limited computing budget, you may have to interrupt training before it has converged properly, yielding a suboptimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### But you can do better than a constant learning rate: if you start with a large learning rate and then reduce it once training stops making fast progress, you can reach a good solution faster than with the optimal constant learning rate. There are many different strategies to reduce the learning rate during training. It can also be beneficial to start with a low learning rate, increase it, then drop it again. These strategies are called learning schedules (I briefly introduced this concept in Chapter 4). These are the most commonly used learning schedules:"

    "## Dropout\n",

    "#### Dropout is one of the most popular regularization techniques for deep neural networks. It was proposed in a paper⁠26 by Geoffrey Hinton et al. in 2012 and further detailed in a 2014 paper⁠27 by Nitish Srivastava et al., and it has proven to be highly successful: many state-of-the-art neural networks use dropout, as it gives them a 1%–2% accuracy boost. This may not sound like a lot, but when a model already has 95% accuracy, getting a 2% accuracy boost means dropping the error rate by almost 40% (going from 5% error to roughly 3%).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### It is a fairly simple algorithm: at every training step, every neuron (including the input neurons, but always excluding the output neurons) has a probability p of being temporarily “dropped out”, meaning it will be entirely ignored during this training step, but it may be active during the next step (see Figure 11-10). The hyperparameter p is called the dropout rate, and it is typically set between 10% and 50%: closer to 20%–30% in recurrent neural nets (see Chapter 15), and closer to 40%–50% in convolutional neural networks (see Chapter 14). After training, neurons don’t get dropped anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### It’s surprising at first that this destructive technique works at all. Would a company perform better if its employees were told to toss a coin every morning to decide whether or not to go to work? Well, who knows; perhaps it would! The company would be forced to adapt its organization; it could not rely on any single person to work the coffee machine or perform any other critical tasks, so this expertise would have to be spread across several people. Employees would have to learn to cooperate with many of their coworkers, not just a handful of them. The company would become much more resilient. If one person quit, it wouldn’t make much of a difference. It’s unclear whether this idea would actually work for companies, but it certainly does for neural networks. Neurons trained with dropout cannot co-adapt with their neighboring neurons; they have to be as useful as possible on their own. They also cannot rely excessively on just a few input neurons; they must pay attention to each of their input neurons. They end up being less sensitive to slight changes in the inputs. In the end, you get a more robust network that generalizes better.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Another way to understand the power of dropout is to realize that a unique neural network is generated at each training step. Since each neuron can be either present or absent, there are a total of 2N possible networks (where N is the total number of droppable neurons). This is such a huge number that it is virtually impossible for the same neural network to be sampled twice. Once you have run 10,000 training steps, you have essentially trained 10,000 different neural networks, each with just one training instance. These neural networks are obviously not independent because they share many of their weights, but they are nevertheless all different. The resulting neural network can be seen as an averaging ensemble of all these smaller neural networks."
