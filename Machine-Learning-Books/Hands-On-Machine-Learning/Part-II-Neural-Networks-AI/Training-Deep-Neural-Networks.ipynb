    "## The Vanishing/Exploding Gradients Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unfortunately, gradients often get smaller and smaller as the algorithm progresses down to the lower layers. As a result, the gradient descent update leaves the lower layers’ connection weights virtually unchanged, and training never converges to a good solution. This is called the vanishing gradients problem. In some cases, the opposite can happen: the gradients can grow bigger and bigger until layers get insanely large weight updates and the algorithm diverges. This is the exploding gradients problem, which surfaces most often in recurrent neural networks (see Chapter 15). More generally, deep neural networks suffer from unstable gradients; different layers may learn at widely different speeds."

    "## Batch Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Although using He initialization along with ReLU (or any of its variants) can significantly reduce the danger of the vanishing/exploding gradients problems at the beginning of training, it doesn’t guarantee that they won’t come back during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In a 2015 paper,⁠12 Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy proposed a technique called batch normalization (BN) that addresses these problems. The technique consists of adding an operation in the model just before or after the activation function of each hidden layer. This operation simply zero-centers and normalizes each input, then scales and shifts the result using two new parameter vectors per layer: one for scaling, the other for shifting. In other words, the operation lets the model learn the optimal scale and mean of each of the layer’s inputs. In many cases, if you add a BN layer as the very first layer of your neural network, you do not need to standardize your training set. That is, there’s no need for StandardScaler or Normalization; the BN layer will do it for you (well, approximately, since it only looks at one batch at a time, and it can also rescale and shift each input feature)."

    "## Gradient Clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Another technique to mitigate the exploding gradients problem is to clip the gradients during backpropagation so that they never exceed some threshold. This is called gradient clipping.⁠14 This technique is generally used in recurrent neural networks, where using batch normalization is tricky (as you will see in Chapter 15).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If you observe that the gradients explode during training (you can track the size of the gradients using TensorBoard), you may want to try clipping by value or clipping by norm, with different thresholds, and see which option performs best on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reusing Pretrained Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### It is generally not a good idea to train a very large DNN from scratch without first trying to find an existing neural network that accomplishes a similar task to the one you are trying to tackle (I will discuss how to find them in Chapter 14). If you find such as neural network, then you can generally reuse most of its layers, except for the top ones. This technique is called transfer learning. It will not only speed up training considerably, but also requires significantly less training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Try freezing all the reused layers first (i.e., make their weights non-trainable so that gradient descent won’t modify them and they will remain fixed), then train your model and see how it performs. Then try unfreezing one or two of the top hidden layers to let backpropagation tweak them and see if performance improves. The more training data you have, the more layers you can unfreeze. It is also useful to reduce the learning rate when you unfreeze reused layers: this will avoid wrecking their fine-tuned weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If you still cannot get good performance, and you have little training data, try dropping the top hidden layer(s) and freezing all the remaining hidden layers again. You can iterate until you find the right number of layers to reuse. If you have plenty of training data, you may try replacing the top hidden layers instead of dropping them, and even adding more hidden layers.\n",

    "## Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Imagine a bowling ball rolling down a gentle slope on a smooth surface: it will start out slowly, but it will quickly pick up momentum until it eventually reaches terminal velocity (if there is some friction or air resistance). This is the core idea behind momentum optimization, proposed by Boris Polyak in 1964.⁠15 In contrast, regular gradient descent will take small steps when the slope is gentle and big steps when the slope is steep, but it will never pick up speed. As a result, regular gradient descent is generally much slower to reach the minimum than momentum optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The one drawback of momentum optimization is that it adds yet another hyperparameter to tune. However, the momentum value of 0.9 usually works well in practice and almost always goes faster than regular gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Rate Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding a good learning rate is very important. If you set it much too high, training may diverge (as discussed in “Gradient Descent”). If you set it too low, training will eventually converge to the optimum, but it will take a very long time. If you set it slightly too high, it will make progress very quickly at first, but it will end up dancing around the optimum and never really settling down. If you have a limited computing budget, you may have to interrupt training before it has converged properly, yielding a suboptimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### But you can do better than a constant learning rate: if you start with a large learning rate and then reduce it once training stops making fast progress, you can reach a good solution faster than with the optimal constant learning rate. There are many different strategies to reduce the learning rate during training. It can also be beneficial to start with a low learning rate, increase it, then drop it again. These strategies are called learning schedules (I briefly introduced this concept in Chapter 4). These are the most commonly used learning schedules:"
