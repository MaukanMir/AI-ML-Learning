    "#### However, when training TensorFlow models on large datasets, you may prefer to use TensorFlow’s own data loading and preprocessing API, called tf.data. It is capable of loading and preprocessing data extremely efficiently, reading from multiple files in parallel using multithreading and queuing, shuffling and batching samples, and more. Plus, it can do all of this on the fly—it loads and preprocesses the next batch of data across multiple CPU cores, while your GPUs or TPUs are busy training the current batch of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The tf.data API lets you handle datasets that don’t fit in memory, and it allows you to make full use of your hardware resources, thereby speeding up training. Off the shelf, the tf.data API can read from text files (such as CSV files), binary files with fixed-size records, and binary files that use TensorFlow’s TFRecord format, which supports records of varying sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The from_tensor_slices() function takes a tensor and creates a tf.data.Dataset whose elements are all the slices of X along the first dimension, so this dataset contains 10 items: tensors 0, 1, 2, …​, 9. In this case we would have obtained the same dataset if we had used tf.data.Dataset.range(10) (except the elements would be 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers)."
