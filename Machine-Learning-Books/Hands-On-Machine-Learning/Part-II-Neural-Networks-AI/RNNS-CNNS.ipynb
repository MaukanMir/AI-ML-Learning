    "#### Weâ€™ll start with the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, developed by Herman Wold in the 1930s: it computes its forecasts using a simple weighted sum of lagged values and corrects these forecasts by adding a moving average, very much like we just discussed. Specifically, the moving average component is computed using a weighted sum of the last few forecast errors. Equation 15-3 shows how the model makes its forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importantly, this model assumes that the time series is stationary. If it is not, then differencing may help. Using differencing over a single time step will produce an approximation of the derivative of the time series: indeed, it will give the slope of the series at each time step. This means that it will eliminate any linear trend, transforming it into a constant value. For example, if you apply one-step differencing to the series [3, 5, 7, 9, 11], you get the differenced series [2, 2, 2, 2]."
