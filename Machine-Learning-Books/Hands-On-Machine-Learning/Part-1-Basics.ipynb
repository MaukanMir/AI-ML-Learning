This is called data snooping bias."

    "##### The similarity measure is typically computed using a radial basis function (RBF)—any function that depends only on the distance between the input value and a fixed point. The most commonly used RBF is the Gaussian RBF, whose output value decays exponentially as the input value moves away from the fixed point. For example, the Gaussian RBF similarity between the housing age x and 35 is given by the equation exp(–γ(x – 35)²). The hyperparameter γ (gamma) determines how quickly the similarity measure decays as x moves away from 35. "

    "#### So far we’ve only looked at the input features, but the target values may also need to be transformed. For example, if the target distribution has a heavy tail, you may choose to replace the target with its logarithm. But if you do, the regression model will now predict the log of the median house value, not the median house value itself. You will need to compute the exponential of the model’s prediction if you want the predicted median house value.\n",

For example, the following code example shows how to scale the labels using a StandardScaler (just like we did for inputs), then train a simple linear regression model on the resulting scaled labels and use it to make predictions on some new data, which we transform back to the original scale using the trained scaler’s inverse_transform() method. Note that we convert the labels from a Pandas Series to a DataFrame, since the StandardScaler expects 2D inputs. Also, in this example we just train the model on a single raw input feature (median income), for simplicity:\n"
