    "#### Of course, real data rarely lends itself to such clean separation. Overlap between classes inevitably prevents a perfect fit. To accommodate this, SVMs support a regularization parameter usually referred to as C that can be adjusted to loosen or tighten the fit. Lower values of C produce a wider margin with more errors on either side of the decision boundary, as shown in Figure 5-2. Higher values yield a tighter fit to the training data with a correspondingly thinner margin and fewer errors. If C is too high, the model might not generalize well. The optimum value varies by dataset. Data scientists typically try different values of C to determine which one performs the best against test data."
