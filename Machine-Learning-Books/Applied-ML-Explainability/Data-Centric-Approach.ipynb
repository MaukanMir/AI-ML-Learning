    "#### To detect feature drifts on categorical features, the popular choice of metric is the population stability index (PSI) (https://www.lexjansen.com/wuss/2017/47_Final_Paper_PDF.pdf). This is a statistical method used to measure the shift in a variable over a period of time. If the overall drift score is more than 0.2 or 20%, then the drift is considered to be significant, establishing the presence of feature drift.\n",

    "#### To detect feature drifts in numeric features, the Wasserstein metric (https://kowshikchilamkurthy.medium.com/wasserstein-distance-contraction-mapping-and-modern-rl-theory-93ef740ae867) is the popular choice. This is a distance function for measuring the distance between two probability distributions. Similar to PSI, if the drift score using the Wasserstein metric is higher than 20%, this is considered to be significant and the numerical feature is considered to have feature drift."
