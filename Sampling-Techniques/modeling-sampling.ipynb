    "The shortest path to a good result on a new classification task is to systematically evaluate a suite of machine learning algorithms in order to discover what works well, then double down on what works well. This approach can also be used for imbalanced classification problems, tailored for the range of data sampling, cost-sensitive, and one-class classification algorithms that one may choose from.\n"
