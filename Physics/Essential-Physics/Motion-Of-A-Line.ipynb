However, the phrase “how fast” more commonly refers to how fast a particle is moving at a given instant—its instantaneous velocity (or simply velocity) ν.\n",

First, ν is the rate at which the particle’s position x is changing with time at a given instant; that is, ν is the derivative of x with respect to t. Second, ν at any instant is the slope of the particle’s position–time curve at the point representing that instant. Velocity is another vector quantity and thus has an associated direction.\n",

(Caution: Speed and average speed can be quite different.) A velocity of +5 m/s and one of −5 m/s both have an associated speed of 5 m/s. The speedometer in a car measures speed, not velocity (it cannot determine the direction)."
