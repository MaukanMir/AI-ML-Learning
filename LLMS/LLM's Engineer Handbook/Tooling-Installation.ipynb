    "#### Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is fundamental in most generative AI applications. RAG’s core responsibility is to inject custom data into the large language model (LLM) to perform a given action (e.g., summarize, reformulate, and extract the injected data). You often want to use the LLM on data it wasn’t trained on (e.g., private or new data). As fine-tuning an LLM is a highly costly operation, RAG is a compelling strategy that bypasses the need for constant fine-tuning to access that new data.\n",
