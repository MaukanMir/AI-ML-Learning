    "#### KNN is a popular technique in recommendation systems, but it has some pitfalls:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scalability: KNN can become computationally expensive and slow when dealing with large datasets, as it requires calculating distances between all pairs of items or users.\n",
    "- Cold-start problem: KNN struggles with new items or users that have limited or no interaction history, as it relies on finding neighbors based on historical data.\n",
    "- Data sparsity: KNN performance can degrade in sparse datasets where there are many missing values, making it challenging to find meaningful neighbors.\n",
    "- Feature relevance: KNN treats all features equally and assumes that all features contribute equally to similarity calculations. This may not hold true in scenarios where some features are more relevant than others.\n",
    "- Choice of K: Selecting the appropriate value of K (number of neighbors) can be subjective and impact the quality of recommendations. A small K may result in noise, while a large K may lead to overly broad recommendations.\n",
    "- Generally speaking, KNN is recommended in scenarios with small datasets with minimal noise (so that outliers, missing values and other noises do not impact the distance metric) and dynamic data (KNN is an instance-based method that doesn’t require retraining and can adapt to changes quickly).\n",

    "## Matrix factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix factorization is a technique used in recommendation systems to analyze and predict user preferences or behaviors based on historical data. It involves decomposing a large matrix into two or more smaller matrices to uncover latent features that contribute to the observed data patterns and address the so-called “curse of dimensionality.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The curse of dimensionality refers to challenges that arise when dealing with high-dimensional data. It leads to increased complexity, sparse data, and difficulties in analysis and modeling due to the exponential growth of data requirements and potential overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Singular value decomposition (SVD) decomposes a matrix into three separate matrices, where the middle matrix contains singular values that represent the importance of different components in the data. It’s widely used in data compression, dimensionality reduction, and collaborative filtering in recommendation systems.\n",
    "- Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique to reduce the dimensionality of data by transforming it into a new coordinate system aligned with the principal components. These components capture the most significant variability in the data, allowing efficient analysis and visualization.\n",
    "- Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) decomposes a matrix into two matrices with non-negative values. It’s often used for topic modeling, image processing, and feature extraction, where the components represent non-negative attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autoencoders are a type of neural network architecture used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. They consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder maps the input data into a lower-dimensional latent space representation, while the decoder attempts to reconstruct the original input data from the encoded representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### VAEs are an extension of traditional autoencoders that introduce probabilistic elements. VAEs not only learn to encode the input data into a latent space but also model the distribution of this latent space using probabilistic methods. This allows for the generation of new data samples from the learned latent space. VAEs are used for generative tasks like image synthesis, anomaly detection, and data imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In both autoencoders and VAEs, the idea is to learn a compressed and meaningful representation of the input data in the latent space, which can be useful for various tasks including feature extraction, data generation, and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fine-tuning: Training an LLM from scratch is a highly computational-intensive activity. An alternative and less intrusive approach to customize an LLM for recommendation systems might be fine-tuning.\n",
    "#### More specifically, the authors of the paper review two main strategies for fine-tuning LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Full-model fine-tuning involves changing the entire model’s weights based on task-specific recommendation datasets.\n",
    "- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning aims to change only a small part of weights or develop trainable adapters to fit specific tasks.\n",
    "- Prompting: The third and “lightest” way of tailoring LLMs to be recommender systems is prompting. According to the authors, there are three main techniques for prompting LLMs:\n",
    "- Conventional prompting aims to unify downstream tasks into language generation tasks by designing text templates or providing a few input-output examples.\n",
    "- In-context learning enables LLMs to learn new tasks based on contextual information without fine-tuning.\n",
    "- Chain-of-thought enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs by providing multiple demonstrations to describe the chain of thought as examples within the prompt. The authors also discuss the advantages and challenges of each technique and provide some examples of existing methods that adopt them.\n",
    "Regardless of the typology, prompting is the fastest way to test whether a general-purpose LLM can tackle recommendation systems’ tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The application of LLMs within the recommendation system domain is raising interest in the research field, and there is already some interesting evidence of the results as seen above."
