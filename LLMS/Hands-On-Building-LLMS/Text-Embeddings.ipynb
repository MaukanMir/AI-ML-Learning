    "#  Creating Text Embedding Models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This process of embedding the input is typically performed by an LLM, which we refer to as an embedding model. The main purpose of such a model is to be as accurate as possible in representing the textual data as an embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### However, what does it mean to be accurate in representation? Typically, we want to capture the semantic nature—the meaning—of documents. If we can capture the core of what the document communicates, we hope to have captured what the document is about. In practice, this means that we expect vectors of documents that are similar to one another to be similar, whereas the embeddings of documents that each discuss something entirely different should be dissimilar. We’ve seen this idea of semantic similarity several times already in this book, and it is visualized in Figure 10-2. This figure is a simplified example. While two-dimensional visualization helps illustrate the proximity and similarity of embeddings, these embeddings typically reside in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An embedding model, however, can be trained for a number of purposes. For example, when we are building a sentiment classifier, we are more interested in the sentiment of texts than their semantic similarity. As illustrated in Figure 10-3, we can fine-tune the model such that documents are closer in n-dimensional space based on their sentiment rather than their semantic nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Either way, an embedding model aims to learn what makes certain documents similar to one another and we can guide this process. By presenting the model with enough examples of semantically similar documents, we can steer toward semantics whereas using examples of sentiment would steer it in that direction."
