    "#### On a separate track, the fast adoption of text generation models led many users to ask the models questions and expect factual answers. And while the models were able to answer fluently and confidently, their answers were not always correct or up-to-date. This problem grew to be known as model “hallucinations,” and one of the leading ways to reduce it is to build systems that can retrieve relevant information and provide it to the LLM to aid it in generating more factual answers. This method, called RAG, is one of the most popular applications of LLMs."
