    "#### LLMs have the potential to enhance symptom checkers (Figure 4-7) dramatically in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Symptom checkers identify salient figures of speech and patient specifics in the text in natural language, and refine them using language qualified by more accurate terms thanks to suggestions made by LLMs trained on a large medical data set (including diagnoses of patients, their cases, and relevant research articles).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Symptom checkers attach predicted levels (probabilities) of benefit to the various possible diagnoses using statistical calculations and clinician-guided heuristics. They engage in a series of follow-up questions based on the results of prior questions in order to discard improbable conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LLMs offer the opportunity for a better understanding of context. LLMs can analyze complex narratives and consider individual contexts like medical history, age, and lifestyle factors, leading to more personalized recommendations. LLMs can provide more nuanced information, highlighting uncertainties and guiding users toward reliable sources such as healthcare professionals. LLMs can identify high-risk cases based on specific symptoms and direct users to seek immediate medical attention. They can continuously learn from new data and feedback, improving accuracy and adapting to evolving medical knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combining large-scale pretraining, expert medical knowledge, and rigorous validation testing, LLM-powered symptom checkers could greatly improve patient self-service capabilities, clinical efficiency, and health outcomes."
