    "#### A fundamental tension exists between machine learning model predictions and clinical practice. Machine learning models often advise early detection of costly comorbidities and recommend preventative measures. In contrast, clinicians at the bedside tend to prioritize immediate patient needs, sometimes at the expense of potential long-term optimizations. Payers are investing heavily in analytics that attempt to identify those more likely to “progress to high-cost status,” based on historical correlations. Predicting the onset of conditions that can be prudently managed earlier, before requiring sustained treatment, will allow payers to steer the patient’s pathway so as to preserve health at lower long-term expense.\n",

    "#### The intricate balance of influence and power requires oversight to ensure that predictive models respect the psychological, economic, and environmental complexities that impact the personal, and not just the actuarial, reliability of modeling the individual risks for both manageability and affordability. The ultimate responsibility for health must remain with each individual.\n",
