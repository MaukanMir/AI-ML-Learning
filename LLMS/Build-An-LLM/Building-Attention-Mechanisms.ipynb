    "## The problem with modeling long sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before we dive into the self-attention mechanism at the heart of LLMs, let’s consider the problem with pre-LLM architectures that do not include attention mechanisms. Suppose we want to develop a language translation model that translates text from one language into another. As shown in figure 3.3, we can’t simply translate a text word by word due to the grammatical structures in the source and target language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To address this problem, it is common to use a deep neural network with two submodules, an encoder and a decoder. The job of the encoder is to first read in and process the entire text, and the decoder then produces the translated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were the most popular encoder–decoder architecture for language translation. An RNN is a type of neural network where outputs from previous steps are fed as inputs to the current step, making them well-suited for sequential data like text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In an encoder–decoder RNN, the input text is fed into the encoder, which processes it sequentially. The encoder updates its hidden state (the internal values at the hidden layers) at each step, trying to capture the entire meaning of the input sentence in the final hidden state, as illustrated in figure 3.4. The decoder then takes this final hidden state to start generating the translated sentence, one word at a time. It also updates its hidden state at each step, which is supposed to carry the context necessary for the next-word prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### While we don’t need to know the inner workings of these encoder–decoder RNNs, the key idea here is that the encoder part processes the entire input text into a hidden state (memory cell). The decoder then takes in this hidden state to produce the output. You can think of this hidden state as an embedding vector, a concept we discussed in chapter 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The big limitation of encoder–decoder RNNs is that the RNN can’t directly access earlier hidden states from the encoder during the decoding phase. Consequently, it relies solely on the current hidden state, which encapsulates all relevant information. This can lead to a loss of context, especially in complex sentences where dependencies might span long distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fortunately, it is not essential to understand RNNs to build an LLM. Just remember that encoder–decoder RNNs had a shortcoming that motivated the design of attention mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capturing data dependencies with attention mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Although RNNs work fine for translating short sentences, they don’t work well for longer texts as they don’t have direct access to previous words in the input. One major shortcoming in this approach is that the RNN must remember the entire encoded input in a single hidden state before passing it to the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hence, researchers developed the Bahdanau attention mechanism for RNNs in 2014 (named after the first author of the respective paper; for more information, see appendix B), which modifies the encoder–decoder RNN such that the decoder can selectively access different parts of the input sequence at each decoding step\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interestingly, only three years later, researchers found that RNN architectures are not required for building deep neural networks for natural language processing and proposed the original transformer architecture (discussed in chapter 1) including a self-attention mechanism inspired by the Bahdanau attention mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Self-attention is a mechanism that allows each position in the input sequence to consider the relevancy of, or “attend to,” all other positions in the same sequence when computing the representation of a sequence. Self-attention is a key component of contemporary LLMs based on the transformer architecture, such as the GPT series.\n",

    "#### Figure 3.6 Self-attention is a mechanism in transformers used to compute more efficient input representations by allowing each position in a sequence to interact with and weigh the importance of all other positions within the same sequence. In this chapter, we will code this self-attention mechanism from the ground up before we code the remaining parts of the GPT-like LLM in the following chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## THE “SELF” IN SELF-ATTENTION\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In self-attention, the “self” refers to the mechanism’s ability to compute attention weights by relating different positions within a single input sequence. It assesses and learns the relationships and dependencies between various parts of the input itself, such as words in a sentence or pixels in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This is in contrast to traditional attention mechanisms, where the focus is on the relationships between elements of two different sequences, such as in sequence-to-sequence models where the attention might be between an input sequence and an output sequence, such as the example depicted in figure 3.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A simple self-attention mechanism without trainable weights\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let’s begin by implementing a simplified variant of self-attention, free from any trainable weights, as summarized in figure 3.7. The goal is to illustrate a few key concepts in self-attention before adding trainable weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Simple Attention Method](/Users/maukanmir/Documents/Machine-Learning/AI-ML-Textbooks/AI-ML-Learning/images/simple-attention.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The goal of self-attention is to compute a context vector for each input element that combines information from all other input elements. In this example, we compute the context vector z(2). The importance or contribution of each input element for computing z(2) is determined by the attention weights a21 to a2T. When computing z(2), the attention weights are calculated with respect to input element x(2) and all other inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example, consider an input text like “Your journey starts with one step.” In this case, each element of the sequence, such as x(1), corresponds to a d-dimensional embedding vector representing a specific token, like “Your.” Figure 3.7 shows these input vectors as three-dimensional embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In self-attention, our goal is to calculate context vectors z(i) for each element x(i) in the input sequence. A context vector can be interpreted as an enriched embedding vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To illustrate this concept, let’s focus on the embedding vector of the second input element, x(2) (which corresponds to the token “journey”), and the corresponding context vector, z(2), shown at the bottom of figure 3.7. This enhanced context vector, z(2), is an embedding that contains information about x(2) and all other input elements, x(1) to x(T).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context vectors play a crucial role in self-attention. Their purpose is to create enriched representations of each element in an input sequence (like a sentence) by incorporating information from all other elements in the sequence (figure 3.7). This is essential in LLMs, which need to understand the relationship and relevance of words in a sentence to each other. Later, we will add trainable weights that help an LLM learn to construct these context vectors so that they are relevant for the LLM to generate the next token. But first, let’s implement a simplified self-attention mechanism to compute these weights and the resulting context vector one step at a time."
