    "### A model registry is a central repository for storing ML models and their metadata and managing the model lifecycle and versions. Once a model training process completes, it saves the model and its metadata in the registry. Then different functions (such as evaluation, testing, and optimization) extend the model metadata or update the model files. Finally, the serving functions or application pipelines load the model and use it for making predictions."
