    "### A feature store provides a single pane of glass for sharing all available features across the organization along with their metadata. When data scientists start a new project, they can access this catalog and easily find features. But a feature store is not just a data layer; it is also a data transformation service enabling users to manipulate raw data and store it as features ready to be used for offline (training) and online (serving), without duplicating the work. In addition, some feature stores support strong security, versioning, and data snapshots, enabling better data lineage, compliance, and manageability."
