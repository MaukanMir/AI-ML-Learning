    "### The theory behind dropout is that neural networks have so much freedom between their numerous layers that it is entirely possible for one layer to evolve a bad behavior and for the next layer to compensate for it. This is not an ideal use of neurons. With dropout, there is a high probability that the neurons “fixing” the problem will not be there in a given training round. The bad behavior of the offending layer therefore becomes obvious, and weights evolve toward a better behavior. Dropout also helps spread the information flow throughout the network, giving all weights fairly equal amounts of training, which can help keep the model balanced."
