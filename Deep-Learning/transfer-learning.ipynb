    "## What Is Transfer Learning?\n",
    "- Transfer learning generally refers to a process where a model trained on one problem is used in some way on a second, related problem. In deep learning, transfer learning is a technique whereby a neural network model is first trained on a problem similar to the problem that is being solved. One or more layers from the trained model are then used in a new model trained on the problem of interest."
