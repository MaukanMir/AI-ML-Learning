    "## What Is GitHub Actions?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You can define GitHub Actions this way: GitHub Actions is an end-to-end GitHub-centric SDLC process. It provides an automation platform and framework that has been missing from GitHub previously and has had to be added on with other solutions such as Jenkins or Travis CI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There’s a lot packed into that one statement. But let’s key in on two parts that are at the heart of the functionality: automation platform and framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automation Platform\n",
    "#### For purposes of the end user, GitHub Actions is a way to create and execute automated workflows tied to GitHub events. Most commonly, you might think of this in the context of CI/CD. As an example, you make a change via a pull request, and GitHub kicks off a continuous delivery pipeline. Prior to GitHub Actions, you would have needed some external tool or process to respond to a notification from GitHub that the pull request happened and then to process it. And the automation that happened after the pull request and initial notification would have been implemented via that external tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With Actions, you now have the means to create this automation within a context managed by, and within, GitHub. You can define the what, when, and how for automated responses to events such as pushes or pull requests. For example, when a push happens in a branch of your repository, automatically grab the latest code and attempt to build it. If a pull request happens for a different branch, automatically build and test the code. If that results in a failure, update a GitHub issue. If there’s not a failure, automatically proceed with putting out a new release.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conveniently, you can create and store your automation definitions and workflows alongside your code in the GitHub repository. And you can edit them there as well. In short, actions make it easier to automate within GitHub because they are a part of GitHub. They are based in a GitHub-provided framework that adds structure and flow. I’ll discuss that next.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Framework\n",
    "#### Taking an automation platform from a jumbled collection of mechanisms to an organized and consumable process requires imposing structure and flow. Without them, you simply have a collection of tools. With them, you can assemble truly useful automation to accomplish whatever set of tasks needs to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Actions, this framework is composed of a core set of related components in GitHub. These components can be put together to execute simple or complex automation in an understandable and predictable way. And this automation is stored in the repository as code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I’ll be talking more about these individual components in Chapter 2. But for a quick overview, it works like this: In response to an occurrence of a matching event, a workflow definition stored within the repository is triggered, which in turn fires off jobs on designated systems called runners. The jobs are made up of sequences of steps that either invoke a predefined action or run a command on the runner’s OS shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### While similar capabilities were available previously in GitHub via mechanisms such as API calls, they were not as easy to assemble at a higher level. Developers often had to invest considerable time and effort to learn how to string together the right API calls and/or integrations with other external tooling (such as Jenkins, Travis CI, etc.). Or they would use custom scripting and programming to be able to get to the desired end goal. This was especially true if they wanted to be able to manage processes through GitHub. (Another workaround was to mirror the repository outside of GitHub for products to use.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actions implements a native framework in GitHub providing a more seamless and flexible experience. This flexibility is enhanced by the Actions Marketplace, a public registry where actions can be published and shared. If you want to create workflows to do common activities (such as checking out code or building with a particular build tool), you can choose from existing actions in the marketplace. If you want or need more extensive logic, for which an action doesn’t already exist, you can code your own custom action using a well-defined structure. Then you can publish and share it with others via the Marketplace if desired. This approach provides a measure of flexibility, reusability, and extensibility not previously available with GitHub. A secondary benefit is that it can enable rapid prototyping and implementation through combining actions for various use cases. I’ll talk about those topics in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are the Use Cases for GitHub Actions?\n",
    "#### When CI/CD first came on the scene, dedicated tools such as Jenkins were the primary means of creating pipelines. These tools were flexible—arguably, too flexible. You had to work hard to tie together individual parts into a pipeline. Gradually, with the widespread adoption of CI/CD, the concept of pipelines has come into its own as a predefined structure. And so too has the ability to define pipelines that go beyond just the basics of building simple tests. Today’s CI/CD pipelines can be very complex and can include advanced testing, multiple integration levels, and automated deployments/releases. GitHub Actions allows you to create workflows as complex as needed to handle these types of operations without ever leaving GitHub’s ecosystem. Further, it allows you to create as many different workflows as needed for additional automation use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### While GitHub Actions does not use the term pipeline in its processes, the overall workflow approach it uses is a similar concept. Workflows chain together smaller units of work called jobs. Jobs are what you often might see in other applications as stages, meaning parts of a larger process that perform a distinct and separate function. In fact, if you’re coming from working with another automation tool, you can think of the overall GitHub Actions flow as being a pipeline, meaning some change or event causes a series of automated actions to happen automatically in response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The main use cases would be in response to something happening in GitHub. But there are also ways for workflows to be kicked off by events outside of that environment, started on a particular schedule, or even initiated manually through the Actions interface in GitHub. I’ll have more to say about these different ways of initiating a workflow in Chapter 2 and also in Chapter 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### While CI or CI/CD is the primary purpose that comes to mind, workflows and actions can be used to automate nearly any process. There are two primary places you can look to get ideas about what actions can be used for: the starter workflows and the Actions Marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflows versus actions\n",
    "#### Just to make sure it’s clear, workflows are the scripts or pipelines that control the flow and sequence of activity in GitHub Actions. The individual actions are the functions that can be called to do targeted tasks from within workflows (like checking out code).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starter Workflows\n",
    "#### To help users bootstrap using Actions, when you start to create a new workflow, GitHub will present example starter workflows. Figure 1-1 shows an example. You don’t have to use one of these, but if they suit your purpose or come close to it, you can click the Configure button and be working on a new workflow very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### As of the time of this writing, the main categories that have starter workflows are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deployment\n",
    "- A set of example workflows for creating deployable objects (like containers) and then deploying them to various cloud platforms\n",
    "#### Security\n",
    "- Primarily a set of code-scanning workflows using various security platforms and their tools\n",
    "#### Continuous Integration\n",
    "- A large number of workflows that cover the areas of building, testing, and/or publishing for a large number of different programming languages and tools\n",
    "#### Automation\n",
    "- Some simple examples for basic automation, including a hello world type, one that demonstrates how to trigger a workflow manually, and a couple that deal with other GitHub constructs such as pull requests and a couple that deal with other GitHub constructs such as pull requests and issues\n",
    "#### Pages\n",
    "- Workflows to package/deploy sites using common tools like Gatsby, Astro, Jekyll, etc."
