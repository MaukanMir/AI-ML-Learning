    "#### There are three main types of deep learning models that we can build for time series forecasting: single-step models, multi-step models, and multi-output models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The single-step model is the simplest of the three. Its output is a single value representing the forecast of one variable one step into the future. The model therefore simply returns a scalar, as shown in figure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next we can have a multi-step model, meaning that we output the value for one target, but for many timesteps into the future. For example, given hourly data, we may want to forecast the next 24 hours. In that case, we have a multi-step model, since we are forecasting 24 timesteps into the future. The output is a 24 Ã— 1 matrix, as shown in figure 12.2.\n"
