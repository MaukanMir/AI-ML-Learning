In such a process, the present value yt is a linear combination of a constant C, the present error term ϵt, which is also white noise, and the past values of the series yt–p. The magnitude of the influence of the past values on the present value is denoted as ϕp, which represents the coefficients of the AR(p)) model. Mathematically, we express a general AR(p) model with equation 5.1.\n",
