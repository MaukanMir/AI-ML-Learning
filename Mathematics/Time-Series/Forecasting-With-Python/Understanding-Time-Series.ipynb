    "\n",
    "#### Visualizing the components of a time series is known as decomposition. Decomposition is defined as a statistical task that separates a time series into its different components. We can visualize each individual component, which will help us identify the trend and seasonal pattern in the data, which is not always straightforward just by looking at a dataset."

    "#### The trend is defined as the slow-moving changes in a time series. We can see that it starts out flat and then steeply goes up, meaning that we have an increasing, or positive, trend in our data. The trend component is sometimes referred to as the level. We can think of the trend component as trying to draw a line through most of the data points to show the general direction of a time series."

We can see that over the course of a year, or four quarters, the earnings per share start low, increase, and decrease again at the end of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Therefore, we can say that the seasonal component shows how we deviate from the trend. Sometimes we have a positive deviation, and we get a peak in the Observed graph. Other times, we have a negative deviation, and we see a trough in Observed."
