    "\n",
    "#### A moving average process, or the moving average (MA) model, states that the current value is linearly dependent on the current and past error terms. The error terms are assumed to be mutually independent and normally distributed, just like white noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A moving average model is denoted as MA(q), where q is the order. The model expresses the present value as a linear combination of the mean of the series μ, the present error term ϵt, and past error terms ϵt–q. The magnitude of the impact of past errors on the present value is quantified using a coefficient denoted as θq. Mathematically, we express a general moving average process of order q as in equation 4.1.\n",
