    "## Objective. What Do you need to forecast?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A forecast is a piece of information that various teams in the supply chain will use to make smart decisions (chapter 2). When discussing demand planning improvement with clients, I always start with why. “Why do you forecast demand? What decisions are you supporting with this forecast?” This should be your starting point too. (Answering these two main questions will also answer a third one: “Who will use this forecast?”) Knowing the types of decisions your supply chain needs to make (e.g., how much to produce, where to deploy inventory, whether to open or close plants) is the first step of the 5-step framework. Based on these decisions, we will assess the relevant material and temporal aggregation levels (chapter 5) as well as the forecasting horizon (chapter 6). We will also discuss how different teams might have to use different forecasting models and processes (chapter 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data. What data do you need to support your forecasting model and process?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The most critical data to collect is unconstrained demand rather than constrained sales (chapters 2 and 3). Moreover, you will also need to assess what external drivers impact your demand (such as promotions, pricing, or product launches) and start collecting this data as well (chapter 14).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics. How do you evaluate forecasting quality?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First, you will need to select relevant metrics to assess your forecasting quality. We will discuss accuracy and bias in chapters 8 and 9. In chapter 10, you will learn how to assess if your forecasting model and process are achieving satisfactory accuracy thanks to benchmarks. In chapter 11, we will refine our metrics to cope with broad product portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Baseline model. How do you create an accurate, automated forecast baseline?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You do not want your demand planning team to generate (and review) every single forecast by hand. Instead, to reduce human work to the minimum, you want to use a forecasting model as powerful as possible to generate a forecast baseline. This model should leverage a wide range of insights (such as promotions and other demand drivers). To create this baseline, you can use time series models (chapter 14), predictive models (chapter 14), or machine learning (chapter 15).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review Process. How to review the baseline forecast, and who should do it?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Once the baseline forecast is generated by your forecasting engine, the enrichment phase can begin: various teams will review the forecast and suggest modifications. These suggestions should improve the baseline forecast because they bring human expertise and insights to which the model doesn’t have access (chapter 16). The cornerstone of this review process should be the forecast value added (FVA) framework. It promotes ownership and accountability (chapter 12) by tracking each team’s modifications to the baseline forecast and measuring how much they improved (or worsened) it. Using this framework, you will achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency and efficacy. On the other side, if you overlook it, be ready to face influence wars (chapter 16) and inefficiencies. Finally, chapter 13 will discuss how to reduce your teams’ workload by focusing their work on the most critical products and those for which they are most likely to add value."
