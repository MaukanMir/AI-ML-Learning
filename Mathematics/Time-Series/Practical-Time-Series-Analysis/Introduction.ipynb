    "## Cross-sectional data\n",

    "#### Cross-sectional data or cross-section of a population is obtained by taking observations from multiple individuals at the same point in time. Cross-sectional data can comprise of observations taken at different points in time, however, in such cases time itself does not play any significant role in the analysis. SAT scores of high school students in a particular year is an example of cross-sectional data. Gross domestic product of countries in a given year is another example of cross-sectional data. Data for customer churn analysis is another example of cross-sectional data. Note that, in case of SAT scores of students and GDP of countries, all the observations have been taken in a single year and this makes the two datasets cross-sectional. In essence, the cross-sectional data represents a snapshot at a given instance of time in both the cases. However, customer data for churn analysis can be obtained from over a span of time such as years and months. But for the purpose of analysis, time might not play an important role and therefore though customer churn data might be sourced from multiple points in time, it may still be considered as a cross-sectional dataset.\n",

    "#### The example of cross-sectional data discussed earlier is from the year 2010 only. However, instead if we consider only one country, for example United States, and take a look at its military expenses and central government debt for a span of 10 years from 2001 to 2010, that would get two time series - one about the US federal military expenditure and the other about debt of US federal government. Therefore, in essence, a time series is made up of quantitative observations on one or more measurable characteristics of an individual entity and taken at multiple points in time. In this case, the data represents yearly military expenditure and government debt for the United States. Time series data is typically characterized by several interesting internal structures such as trend, seasonality, stationarity, autocorrelation, and so on. These will be conceptually discussed in the coming sections in this chapter."
