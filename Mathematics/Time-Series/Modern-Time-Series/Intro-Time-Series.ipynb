    "#### The trend is a long-term change in the mean of a time series. It is the smooth and steady movement of a time series in a particular direction. When the time series moves upward, we say there is an upward or increasing trend, while when it moves downward, we say there is a downward or decreasing trend.\n",

    "## Seasonal\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When a time series exhibits regular, repetitive, up-and-down fluctuations, we call that seasonality. For instance, retail sales typically shoot up during the holidays, specifically Christmas in western countries. Similarly, electricity consumption peaks during the summer months in the tropics and the winter months in colder countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cyclical Component\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The cyclical component is often confused with seasonality, but it stands apart due to a very subtle difference. Like seasonality, the cyclical component also exhibits a similar up-and-down pattern around the trend line, but instead of repeating the pattern every period, the cyclical component is irregular. A good example of this is economic recession, which happens over a 10-year cycle. However, this doesn’t happen like clockwork; sometimes, it can be fewer or more than every 10 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The irregular component\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This component is left after removing the trends, seasonality, and cyclicity from a time series. Traditionally, this component is considered unpredictable and is also called the residual or error term. In common classical statistics-based models, the point of any “model” is to capture all the other components to the point that the only part that is not captured is the irregular component. In modern machine learning, we do not consider this component entirely unpredictable. We try to capture this component, or parts of it, by using exogenous variables. For instance, the irregular component of retail sales may be explained as the different promotional activities they run. When we have this additional information, the “unpredictable” component starts to become predictable again. But no matter how many additional variables you add to the model, there will always be some component, which is the true irregular component (or true error), that is left behind."
