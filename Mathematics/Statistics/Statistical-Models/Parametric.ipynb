    "#### The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test focuses more on the centrality of the data. Consequently, however, the test has less power if there is a wide variance around the center of the data. Anderson-Darling focuses more on the tails of the data than the center and is more likely to identify non-conformity to normality if data is heavy-tailed with extreme outliers. These two tests perform well on large sample sizes but do not have as much power when sample sizes are lower. The third test we consider, Shapiro-Wilk, is more general than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling tests and therefore more robust to small sample sizes. Based on these traits, it may be more useful to use Shapiro-Wilk tests in an automated pipeline. Alternatively, it may be better to lower the level of confidence for the test being applied."
