    "- The entire group, every individual item or entity, is referred to as the population. In most cases, the population of interest is so large that it is not practical or even possible to collect data on every entity in the population. For instance, using the voting example, it would probably not be possible to poll every person that voted in an election. Even if it was possible to reach all the voters for the election of interest, many voters may not consent to polling, which would prevent collection on the entire population. \n",
    "- Fortunately, we do not need to collect data on the entire population of interest. Inferences about a population can be made using a subset of the population. This subset of the population is called a sample. This is the main idea of statistical modeling. A model will be created using a sample and inferences will be made about the population."

    "#### The random assignment of treatments refers to two motivators:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The first motivator is to gain an understanding of specific input variables and their influence on the response â€“ for example, understanding whether assigning treatment A to a specific individual may produce more favorable outcomes than a placebo.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The second motivator is to remove the impact of external variables on the outcomes of a study. These external variables, called confounding variables (or confounders), are important to remove as they often prove difficult to control. They may have unpredictable values or even be unknown to the researcher. The consequence of including confounders is that the outcomes of a study may not be replicable, which can be costly. While confounders can influence outcomes, they can also influence input variables, as well as the relationships between those variables."
