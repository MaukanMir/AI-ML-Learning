    "- Uncertainty is the biggest source of difficulty for beginners in machine learning, especially developers.\n",
    "- Noise in data, incomplete coverage of the domain, and imperfect models provide the three main sources of uncertainty in machine learning.\n",
    "- Probability provides the foundation and tools for quantifying, handling, and harnessing uncertainty in applied machine learning.\n",

    "#### In many cases, it is more practical to use a simple but uncertain rule rather than a complex but certain one, even if the true rule is deterministic and our modeling system has the fidelity to accommodate a complex rule."
