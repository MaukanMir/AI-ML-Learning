    "##### The variance is the spread of the values of a random variable from the mean. This is typically denoted as a function V ar; for example, V ar(X) is the variance of the random variable X or V ar(f (x)) for the variance of values drawn from the domain of X using the function f (). The square root of the variance normalizes the value and is referred to as the standard deviation. The variance between two variables is called the covariance and summarizes the linear relationship for how two random variables change together.\n",
