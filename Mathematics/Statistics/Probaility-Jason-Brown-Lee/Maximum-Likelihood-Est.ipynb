    "#### One solution to probability density estimation is referred to as Maximum Likelihood Estimation, or MLE for short. Maximum Likelihood Estimation involves treating the problem as an optimization or search problem, where we seek a set of parameters that results in the best fit for the joint probability of the data sample (X). First, it involves defining a parameter called theta (θ) that defines both the choice of the probability density function and the parameters of that distribution. It may be a vector of numerical values whose values change smoothly and map to different probability distributions and their parameters. In Maximum Likelihood Estimation, we wish to maximize the probability of observing the data from the joint probability distribution given a specific probability distribution and its parameters, stated formally as:\n",
