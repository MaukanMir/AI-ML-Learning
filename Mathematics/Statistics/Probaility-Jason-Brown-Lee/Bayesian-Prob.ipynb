    "#### The terms in the Bayes Theorem equation are given names depending on the context where the equation is used. It can be helpful to think about the calculation from these different perspectives and help to map your problem onto the equation. Firstly, in general the result P(A|B) is referred to as the posterior probability and P(A) is referred to as the prior probability.\n",
