    "## Frequentist Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "- The frequentist approach to probability is objective. Events are observed and counted, and their frequencies provide the basis for directly calculating a probability, hence the name frequentist.\n",
    "Probability theory was originally developed to analyze the frequencies of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bayesian Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Bayesian approach to probability is subjective. Probabilities are assigned to events based on evidence and personal belief and are centered around Bayesâ€™ theorem, hence the name Bayesian. This allows probabilities to be assigned to very infrequent events and events that have not been observed before, unlike frequentist probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One big advantage of the Bayesian interpretation is that it can be used to model our uncertainty about events that do not have long term frequencies."
