    "##### This definition is abstract but fundamental; one of the most important skills to develop when studying probability and statistics is the ability to go back and forth between abstract ideas and concrete examples. Relatedly, it is important to work on recognizing the essential pattern or structure of a problem and how it connects to problems you have studied previously. We will often discuss stories that involve tossing coins or drawing balls from urns because they are simple, convenient scenarios to work with, but many other problems are isomorphic: they have the same essential structure, but in a different guise."
