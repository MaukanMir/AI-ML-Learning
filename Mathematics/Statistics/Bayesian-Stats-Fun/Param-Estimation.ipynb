    "#### What we’ve arrived at here is formally called the expectation or mean of our data. It is simply the sum of each value weighted by its probability. If we denote each of our measurements as xi and the probability of each measurement as pi, we mathematically define the mean—which is generally represented by μ (the lowercase Greek letter mu)—as follows:\n",

    "#### A fundamental question you should always ask yourself when averaging data is: “What exactly am I trying to measure and what does this value really mean?” For our snowfall example, the answer is easy: we’re trying to estimate how much snow actually fell last night before the wind blew it around. However, when we’re measuring the “average height,” the answer is less clear. There is no such thing as an average person, and the differences in heights we observe aren’t errors—they’re truly different heights. A person isn’t 5’5” because part of their height drifted onto a 6’3” person!"
