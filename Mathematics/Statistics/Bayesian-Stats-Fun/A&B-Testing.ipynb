    "## Monte Carlo Simulations\n",
    "#### The accurate answer to which email variant generates a higher click-through rate lies somewhere in the intersection of the distributions of A and B. Fortunately, we have a way to figure it out: a Monte Carlo simulation. A Monte Carlo simulation is any technique that makes use of random sampling to solve a problem. In this case, we’re going to randomly sample from the two distributions, where each sample is chosen based on its probability in the distribution so that samples in a high-probability region will appear more frequently. For example, as we can see in Figure 15-2, a value greater than 0.2 is far more likely to be sampled from A than a value less than 0.2. However, a random sample from distribution B is nearly certain to be above 0.2. In our random sampling, we might pick out a value of 0.2 for variant A and 0.35 for variant B. Each sample is random, and based on the relative probability of values in the A and B distributions. The values 0.2 for A and 0.35 for B both could be the true conversion rate for each variant based on the evidence we’ve observed. This individual sampling from the two distributions confirms the belief that variant B is, in fact, superior to A, since 0.35 is larger than 0.2."
