    "## Monte Carlo Simulations\n",
    "#### The accurate answer to which email variant generates a higher click-through rate lies somewhere in the intersection of the distributions of A and B. Fortunately, we have a way to figure it out: a Monte Carlo simulation. A Monte Carlo simulation is any technique that makes use of random sampling to solve a problem. In this case, we’re going to randomly sample from the two distributions, where each sample is chosen based on its probability in the distribution so that samples in a high-probability region will appear more frequently. For example, as we can see in Figure 15-2, a value greater than 0.2 is far more likely to be sampled from A than a value less than 0.2. However, a random sample from distribution B is nearly certain to be above 0.2. In our random sampling, we might pick out a value of 0.2 for variant A and 0.35 for variant B. Each sample is random, and based on the relative probability of values in the A and B distributions. The values 0.2 for A and 0.35 for B both could be the true conversion rate for each variant based on the evidence we’ve observed. This individual sampling from the two distributions confirms the belief that variant B is, in fact, superior to A, since 0.35 is larger than 0.2."

    "#### In this chapter we saw how parameter estimation naturally extends to a form of hypothesis testing. If the hypothesis we want to test is “variant B has a better conversion rate than variant A,” we can start by first doing parameter estimation for the possible conversion rates of each variant. Once we know those estimates, we can use the Monte Carlo simulation in order to sample from them. By comparing these samples, we can come up with a probability that our hypothesis is true. Finally, we can take our test one step further by seeing how well our new variant performs in these possible worlds, estimating not only whether the hypothesis is true, but also how much improvement we are likely to see."
