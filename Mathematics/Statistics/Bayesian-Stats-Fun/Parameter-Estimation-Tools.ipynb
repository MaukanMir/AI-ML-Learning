    "#### The most common mathematical use of the PDF is in integration, to solve for probabilities associated with various ranges, just as we did in the previous section. However, we can save ourselves a lot of effort with the cumulative distribution function (CDF), which sums all parts of our distribution, replacing a lot of calculus work."

    "## Visualizing and Interpreting the CDF\n",
    "#### The PDF is most useful visually for quickly estimating where the peak of a distribution is, and for getting a rough sense of the width (variance) and shape of a distribution. However, with the PDF it is very difficult to reason about the probability of various ranges visually. The CDF is a much better tool for this. For example, we can use the CDF in Figure 13-4 to visually reason about a much wider range of probabilistic estimates for our problem than we can using the PDF alone. "

    "#### The median is the point in the data at which half the values fall on one side and half on the otherâ€”it is the exact middle value of our data. In other words, the probability of a value being greater than the median and the probability of it being less than the median are both 0.5. The median is particularly useful for summarizing the data in cases where it contains extreme values."
