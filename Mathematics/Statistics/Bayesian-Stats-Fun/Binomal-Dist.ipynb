    "#### The distribution you’ll learn about here is the binomial distribution, used to calculate the probability of a certain number of successful outcomes, given a number of trials and the probability of the successful outcome. The “bi” in the term binomial refers to the two possible outcomes that we’re concerned with: an event happening and an event not happening. If there are more than two outcomes, the distribution is called multinomial. Example problems that follow a binomial distribution include the probability of:\n",

    "- Buying 1 million lottery tickets and winning at least once\n",
    "- Rolling fewer than three 20s in 10 rolls of a 20-sided die"
