    "#### An important thing to note about conditional probabilities and dependence is that, in practice, knowing how two events are related is often difficult. For example, we might ask about the probability of someone owning a pickup truck and having a work commute of over an hour. While we can come up with plenty of reasons one might be dependent on the other—maybe people with pickup trucks tend to live in more rural areas and commute less—we might not have the data to support this. Assuming that two events are independent (even when they likely aren’t) is a very common practice in statistics. But, as with our example for picking a color blind male, this assumption can sometimes give us very wrong results. While assuming independence is often a practical necessity, never forget how much of an impact dependence can have."

Conditional probabilities are more complicated to work with than independent probabili-ties—we had to update our product rule to account for dependencies—but they lead us to Bayes’ theorem, which is fundamental to understanding how we can use data to update what we believe about the world."

Let’s start by just working on the probability of being color blind given someone is male, and the probability of having GBS given they’ve received the flu vaccine. Notice that we’re taking a bit of a shortcut, since being male is independent from GBS (as far as we’re concerned here) and having a flu vaccine has no impact on being color blind. We’ll make each of these into a separate probability:\n",
