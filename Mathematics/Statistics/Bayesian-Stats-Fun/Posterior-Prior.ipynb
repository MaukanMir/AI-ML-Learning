    "#### Bayes’ theorem allows us to quantify exactly how much our observed data changes our beliefs. In this case, what we want to know is: P(belief | data). In plain English, we want to quantify how strongly we hold our beliefs given the data we’ve observed. The technical term for this part of the formula is the posterior probability, and it’s what we’ll use Bayes’ theorem to solve for."
