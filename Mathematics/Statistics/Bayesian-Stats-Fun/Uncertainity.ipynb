    "#### The probability of one event OR another event occurring is slightly more complicated because the events can either be mutually exclusive or not mutually exclusive. Events are mutually exclusive if one event happening implies the other possible events cannot happen. For example, the possible outcomes of rolling a die are mutually exclusive because a single roll cannot yield both a 1 and a 6. However, say a baseball game will be cancelled if it is either raining or the coach is sick; these events are not mutually exclusive because it is perfectly possible that the coach is sick and it rains.\n",

    "#### we can see that, as long as events are mutually exclusive, we can simply add up all of the probabilities of each possible event to get the probability of either event happening to calculate the probability of one event OR the other. Another example of this is rolling a die. We know that the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, and the same is true for rolling a 2:"
