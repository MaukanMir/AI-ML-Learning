    "#### We call the result of this formula the mean absolute deviation (MAD). The MAD is a very useful and intuitive measure of how spread out your observations are. Given that group a has a MAD of 0.04 and group b around 0.4, we can now say that group b is about 10 times as spread out as group a.\n",
