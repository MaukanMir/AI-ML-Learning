    "#### Inferential statistics tries to uncover attributes about a larger population, often based on a sample. It is often misunderstood and less intuitive than descriptive statistics. Often we are interested in studying a group that is too large to observe (e.g., average height of adolescents in North America) and we have to resort to using only a few members of that group to infer conclusions about them. As you can guess, this is not easy to get right. After all, we are trying to represent a population with a sample that may not be representative. We will explore these caveats along the way."

    "\n",
    "#### One interesting thing to note here too is that in our margin of error formula, the larger n becomes, the narrower our confidence interval becomes! This makes sense because if we have a larger sample, we are more confident in the population mean falling in a smaller range, hence why it’s called a confidence interval."
