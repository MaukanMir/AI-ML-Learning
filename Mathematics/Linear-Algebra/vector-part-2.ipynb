Now consider that a subspace can be a smaller portion of a larger space. Putting these together: span is the mechanism of creating a subspace. (On the other hand, when you use span as a noun, then span and subspace refer to the same infinite vector set."

Then use a for loop to implement the linear weighted combination operation. Initialize the output vector using np.zeros(). Confirm that you get the same result as in the previous code."
