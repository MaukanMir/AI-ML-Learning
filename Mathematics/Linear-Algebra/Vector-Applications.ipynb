    "#### Correlation is one of the most fundamental and important analysis methods in statistics and machine learning. A correlation coefficient is a single number that quantifies the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation coefficients range from −1 to +1, with −1 indicating a perfect negative relationship, +1 a perfect positive relationships, and 0 indicating no linear relationship. "
