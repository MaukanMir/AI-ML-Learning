    "#### Let’s start with covariance. Covariance is simply the numerator of the correlation equation—in other words, the dot product between two mean-centered variables. Covariance is interpreted in the same way as correlation (positive when variables move together, negative when variables move apart, zero when the variables have no linear relationship), except that covariance retains the scale of the data, and therefore is not bound by ±1."
