    "### Remember that a linear weighted combination of vectors involves scalar multiplying and summing a set of vectors. Two modifications to this concept will extend linear weighted combination to the column space of a matrix. First, we conceptualize a matrix as a set of column vectors. Second, we consider the infinity of real-valued scalars instead of working with a specific set of scalars. An infinite number of scalars gives an infinite number of ways to combine a set of vectors. That resulting infinite set of vectors is called the column space of a matrix."
