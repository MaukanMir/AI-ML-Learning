    "#### Another thing we can learn from this experiment is the concept of span; the continuing black line is an example of a span. All of the vectors that result from a linear combination define the span. For instance, in the case of −→i and −→j, the span is the entire vector space because we can get all the vectors within the vector space with a linear combination of these vectors, whereas with −→  z and −→  w, the span is a line."

A vector space can have more than one basis, and ℝ2 is one example of a space that contains many basis. \n",
