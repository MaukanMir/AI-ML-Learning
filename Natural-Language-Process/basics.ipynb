    "## Bag-of-Words\n",
    "\n",
    "### In bag-of-words (BoW) featurization, a text document is converted into a vector of counts. (A vector is just a collection of n numbers.) The vector contains an entry for every possible word in the vocabulary. If the word—say, “aardvark”—appears three times in the document, then the feature vector has a count of 3 in the position corresponding to that word. If a word in the vocabulary doesn’t appear in the document, then it gets a count of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag-of-words converts a text document into a flat vector. It is “flat” because it doesn’t contain any of the original textual structures. The original text is a sequence of words. But a bag-of-words has no sequence; it just remembers how many times each word appears in the text. Thus, as Figure 3-2 demonstrates, the ordering of words in the vector is not important, as long as it is consistent for all documents in the dataset. Neither does bag-of-words represent any concept of word hierarchy. For example, the concept of “animal” includes “dog,” “cat,” “raven,” etc. But in a bag-of-words representation, these words are all equal elements of the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag-of-words is not perfect. Breaking down a sentence into single words can destroy the semantic meaning. For instance, “not bad” semantically means “decent” or even “good” (especially if you’re British). But “not” and “bad” constitute a floating negation plus a negative sentiment. “toy dog” and “dog toy” could be very different things (unless it’s a dog toy of a toy dog), and the meaning is lost with the singleton words “toy” and “dog.” It’s easy to come up with many such examples.

    "## Bag-of-n-Grams\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag-of-n-Grams, or bag-of-n-grams, is a natural extension of bag-of-words. An n-gram is a sequence of n tokens. A word is essentially a 1-gram, also known as a unigram. After tokenization, the counting mechanism can collate individual tokens into word counts, or count overlapping sequences as n-grams. For example, the sentence “Emma knocked on the door” generates the n-grams “Emma knocked,” “knocked on,” “on the,” and “the door.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### n-grams retain more of the original sequence structure of the text, and therefore the bag-of-n-grams representation can be more informative. However, this comes at a cost. Theoretically, with k unique words, there could be k2 unique 2-grams (also called bigrams). In practice, there are not nearly so many, because not every word can follow every other word. Nevertheless, there are usually a lot more distinct n-grams (n > 1) than words. This means that bag-of-n-grams is a much bigger and sparser feature space. It also means that n-grams are more expensive to compute, store, and model. The larger n is, the richer the information, and the greater the cost.\n"
