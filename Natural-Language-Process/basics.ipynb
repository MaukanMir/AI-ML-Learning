    "### In bag-of-words (BoW) featurization, a text document is converted into a vector of counts. (A vector is just a collection of n numbers.) The vector contains an entry for every possible word in the vocabulary. If the word—say, “aardvark”—appears three times in the document, then the feature vector has a count of 3 in the position corresponding to that word. If a word in the vocabulary doesn’t appear in the document, then it gets a count of 0."
