    "## What is Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "- The number of input variables or features for a dataset is referred to as its dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a dataset. More input features often make a predictive modeling task more challenging to model, more generally referred to as the curse of dimensionality.High-dimensionality statistics and dimensionality reduction techniques are often used for data visualization. Nevertheless these techniques can be used in applied machine learning to simplify a classification or regression dataset in order to better fit a predictive model."

    "### Problem With Many Input Variables\n",
    "- Having a large number of dimensions in the feature space can mean that the volume of that space is very large, and in turn, the points that we have in that space (rows of data) often represent a small and non-representative sample. This can dramatically impact the performance of machine learning algorithms fit on data with many input features, generally referred to as the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, it is often desirable to reduce the number of input features. This reduces the number of dimensions of the feature space, hence the name dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A model with too many degrees of freedom is likely to overfit the training dataset and therefore may not perform well on new data. It is desirable to have simple models that generalize well, and in turn, input data with few input variables. This is particularly true for linear models where the number of inputs and the degrees of freedom of the model are often closely related."

    "### Dimensionality reduction is about getting rid of “uninformative information” while retaining the crucial bits. There are many ways to define “uninformative.” PCA focuses on the notion of linear dependency. In “The Anatomy of a Matrix”, we describe the column space of a data matrix as the span of all feature vectors. If the column space is small compared to the total number of features, then most of the features are linear combinations of a few key features. Linearly dependent features are a waste of space and computation power because the information could have been encoded in much fewer features. To avoid this situation, principal component analysis tries to reduce such “fluff” by squashing the data into a much lower-dimensional linear subspace."
