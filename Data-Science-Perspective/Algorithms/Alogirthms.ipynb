They find wide applications in various practical scenarios, such as estimating product sales based on price or determining crop yield based on rainfall and fertilizer.\n",

    "### Logistic regression is commonly employed for binary and multi-class classification tasks. It can predict the probability of an event occurring, such as whether a person will click on an advertisement or qualify for a loan. Logistic regression is a valuable tool in real-world scenarios where the outcome is binary and requires estimating the likelihood of a particular class. By utilizing a logistic function, this algorithm maps the input variables to a probability score, enabling effective classification decision-making."
