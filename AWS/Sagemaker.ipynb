However, GPUs are less cost-effective to keep running when a model is not being trained. So you can make use of this decoupled architecture by simply using an ETL service like AWS Glue or Amazon EMR, which use Apache Spark for your ETL jobs and Amazon SageMaker to train, test, and deploy your models."

    "- Endpoint configurations: Amazon SageMaker allows you to deploy multiple weighted models to a single endpoint. This means you can route a specific number of requests to one endpoint. What does this mean? Well, let’s say you have one model in use. You want to replace it with a new model. However, you cannot simply remove the first model that is already in use. In this scenario, you can use the VariantWeight API to make the endpoints serve 80% of the requests with the old model and 20% of the requests with the new model. This is the most common production scenario where the data changes rapidly and the model needs to be trained and tuned periodically. Another possible use case is to test the model results with live data, then a certain percentage of the requests can be routed to the new model, and the results can be monitored to ascertain the accuracy of the model on real-time unseen data."
