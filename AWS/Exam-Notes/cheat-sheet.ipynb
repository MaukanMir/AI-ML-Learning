Separating randomly distributed data in a two-dimensional space can be a daunting and difficult task. The RBF Kernel provides an efficient way of mapping data (e.g., 2-D) into a higher dimension (e.g, 3-D). In doing so, we can conveniently apply the decision surface/hyperplane where we mainly based our model predictions."
