Similarly, you can choose to automatically run the script only once when the notebook instance is created."

Separating randomly distributed data in a two-dimensional space can be a daunting and difficult task. The RBF Kernel provides an efficient way of mapping data (e.g., 2-D) into a higher dimension (e.g, 3-D). In doing so, we can conveniently apply the decision surface/hyperplane where we mainly based our model predictions."

Step Functions have different useful states that can be used in implementing the solution such as the Task State, Wait State, and Fail State. For example, we can define ETL jobs using the Task State, and wait for other conditions to happen before proceeding on to the next state using Wait State. Handling errors and exemptions are also fairly easy to do using Fail State. Finally, we can use the combination of Amazon CloudWatch Alarms and Amazon SNS for notifications. Since AWS Lambda can be directly triggered through S3 Event Notifications, we can use it to start the AWS Step Functions workflow."
