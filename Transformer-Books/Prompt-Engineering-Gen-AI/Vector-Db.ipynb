    "#### A vector database is a tool most commonly used for storing text data in a way that enables querying based on similarity or semantic meaning. This technology is used to decrease hallucinations (where the AI model makes something up) by referencing data the model isn’t trained on, significantly improving the accuracy and quality of the LLM’s response. Use cases for vector databases also include reading documents, recommending similar products, or remembering past conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A vector database stores the text records with their vector representation as the key. This is unlike other types of databases, where you might find records based on an ID, relation, or where the text contains a string. For example, if you queried a relational database based on the text in Figure 5-2 to find records where text contains mouse, you’d return the record mickey mouse but nothing else, as no other record contains that exact phrase. With vectors search you could also return the records cheese and trap, because they are closely associated, even though they aren’t an exact match for your query."
