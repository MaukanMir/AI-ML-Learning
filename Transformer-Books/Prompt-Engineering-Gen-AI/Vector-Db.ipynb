    "#### A vector database is a tool most commonly used for storing text data in a way that enables querying based on similarity or semantic meaning. This technology is used to decrease hallucinations (where the AI model makes something up) by referencing data the model isn’t trained on, significantly improving the accuracy and quality of the LLM’s response. Use cases for vector databases also include reading documents, recommending similar products, or remembering past conversations."
