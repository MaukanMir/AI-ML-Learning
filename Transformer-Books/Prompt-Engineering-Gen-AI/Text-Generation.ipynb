    "## Leveraging Quantization and LoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One of the game-changing aspects of these open source models is the potential for quantization and the use of LoRA (low-rank approximations). These techniques allow developers to fit the models into smaller hardware footprints. Quantization helps to reduce the numerical precision of the model’s parameters, thereby shrinking the overall size of the model without a significant loss in performance. Meanwhile, LoRA assists in optimizing the network’s architecture, making it more efficient to run on consumer-grade hardware."
