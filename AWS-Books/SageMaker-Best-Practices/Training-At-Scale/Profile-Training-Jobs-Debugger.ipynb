To use Amazon SageMaker Debugger, you must enhance Estimator with three additional configuration parameters: DebuggerHookConfig, Rules, and ProfilerConfig\n",

If this location is not specified, Debugger uses the default path, s3://<output_path>/debug-output/, where <output_path>Â is the output path of the SageMaker training job. The CollectionConfig list allows you to organize the debug data or tensors into collections for easier analysis. A tensor represents the state of a training network at a specific time during the training process. Data is collected at intervals, as specified by save_interval, which is the number of steps in a training run.\n",

You can choose to collect all of the available tensors or a subset of them. In the preceding code sample, Debugger is gathering the metrics collection."
