    "#### The smaller version of our dataset (covering 1 month) is about 5 GB of data. We can analyze that dataset on a modern workstation without too much difficulty. But what about the full dataset, which is closer to 500 GB? If we want to prepare the full dataset, we need to work with horizontally scalable cluster computing frameworks. Furthermore, activities such as encoding categorical variables can take quite some time if we use inefficient processing frameworks.\n",

But we can also export the results of a flow into Amazon SageMaker Feature Store, generate a SageMaker pipeline, create a Data Wrangler job, or generate Python code. We will not use these capabilities now, but feel free to experiment with them.\n",

We will write a SageMaker processing job that uses Spark ML for data preparation. (Alternatively, you can use Dask, but at the time of writing, SageMaker Processing does not provide a Dask container out of the box.)\n",

For processing large datasets in their entirety, switch to programmatic use of processing jobs using the Spark framework to take advantage of parallel processing.
