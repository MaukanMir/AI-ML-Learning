    "## SageMaker Ground Truth\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Obtaining labeled data for classification, regression, and other tasks is often the biggest barrier to ML projects, as many companies have a lot of data but have not explicitly labeled it according to business properties such as anomalous and high lifetime value. SageMaker Ground Truth helps you systematically label data by defining a labeling workflow and assigning labeling tasks to a human workforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SageMaker Data Wrangler\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Wrangler helps you understand your data and perform feature engineering. Data Wrangler works with data stored in S3 (optionally accessed via Athena) and Redshift and performs typical visualization and transformations, such as correlation plots and categorical encoding. You can combine a series of transformations into a data flow and export that flow into an MLOps pipeline. The following screenshot shows an example of Data Wrangler information for a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "## SageMaker Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SageMaker Processing jobs help you run data processing and feature engineering tasks on your datasets. By providing your own Docker image containing your code, or using a pre-built Spark or sklearn container, you can normalize and transform data to prepare your features. The following diagram shows the logical flow of a SageMaker Processing job:\n",
    "\n",
    "## SageMaker Feature Store\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SageMaker Feature Store helps you organize and share your prepared features. Using a feature store improves quality and saves time by letting you reuse features rather than duplicate complex feature engineering code and computations that have already been done. Feature Store supports both batch and stream storage and retrieval. The following screenshot shows an example of feature group information:\n",
    "\n",
    "## SageMaker Clarify\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SageMaker Clarify helps you understand model behavior and calculate bias metrics from your model. It checks for imbalance in the dataset, models that give different results based on certain attributes, and bias that appears due to data drift. It can also use leading explainability algorithms such as SHAP to help you explain individual predictions to get a sense of which features drive model behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "## HPO\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some ML algorithms accept tens of hyperparameters as inputs. Tuning these by hand is time-consuming. Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) simplifies that process by letting you define the hyperparameters you want to experiment with, the ranges to work over, and the metric you want to optimize. The following screenshot shows example output for an HPO job\n",
    "\n",
    "## SageMaker Debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SageMaker Debugger helps you debug and, depending on your ML framework, profile your training jobs. While making training jobs run faster is always helpful, debugging is particularly useful if you are writing your own deep learning code with neural networks. Problems such as exploding gradients or mysterious NaN in your tensors are quite tough to track down, particularly in distributed training jobs. Debugger can effectively help you set breakpoints to see where things are going wrong. The following figure shows an example of the training and validation loss captured by SageMaker Debugger:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In some cases, you need to get a large number of inferences at once, in which case SageMaker provides a batch inference capability. But if you need to get inferences closer to real time, you can host your model in a SageMaker managed endpoint. SageMaker handles the deployment and scaling of your endpoints. Just as important, SageMaker lets you host multiple models in a single endpoint. That's useful both for A/B testing (that is, you can direct some percentage of traffic to a newer model) and for hosting multiple models that are tuned for different traffic segments."
