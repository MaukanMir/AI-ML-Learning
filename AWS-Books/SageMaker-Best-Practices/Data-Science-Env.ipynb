    "#### Each resource that gets provisioned through a CloudFormation template includes a set of properties that define how a resource should be configured. Defining these properties through code allows you to consistently provision resources that are configured according to pre-defined specifications. Properties include important configuration options, such as launching environments with a VPC attached or enforcing controls such as encryption at rest. CloudFormation also allows for parameters that can be defined in the template and passed in when launching a CloudFormation stack."
